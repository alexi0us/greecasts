==================

Thats a small utility which creates itunes podcast feeds for radio programs posted online

I have created the feed for Xatzinikolaou daily program and the plan is to do the same for ellinofreneia and Kaneli

Backlog
-----------
i) Logging in all files for easy debugging
ii) Keep only the last 10 programs to save some disk space
iii) Investigate if more items can be moved under common functions
iv)rss_gen.py should be generic for all podcasts. Remove references for current podcasts
iv) Start working on ellinofreneia
