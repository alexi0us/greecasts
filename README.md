Greecast Utility
==================

Thats a small utility which creates itunes podcast feeds for radio programs posted online

I have created the feed for Xatzinikolaou daily program and the plan is to do the same for ellinofreneia and Kaneli

Backlog
-----------

i) Keep only the last 10 programs to save some disk space

ii)rss_gen.py should be generic for all podcasts. Remove references for current podcasts.

iii) Start working on ellinofreneia

iv)Add itunes fields like description etc

vi)Check that size of the files is not zero
